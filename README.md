# BMIcalculator
This is a React Native application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. The app classifies the BMI result into categories (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese) and displays a toast popup with the result. It also saves the last calculated BMI locally using AsyncStorage.
